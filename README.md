# tiny11builder

My fork of Tiny11 builder for personal use. Includes the following changes over the original:
- More bloatware removed - Teams, Outlook, DevHome, BingSearch, WebExperience (widgets), Sticky Notes, Camera. All can be easily reinstalled using Windows Store
- Disabled Windows Spotlight (dynamic lockscreen wallpapers) and "fun facts" on lockscreen
- Prompt to disable automatic device driver installation as soon as you connect to a network
- Prompt to disable automatic updates of Windows Store apps
